# Printed Products Warehouse

For the course project, my task was to develop a Java application. The general name of the application is Warehouse Search System. Warehouse Search System is a Java console application that allows users to search for products in a warehouse inventory using the required combination of parameters (e.g., name, ID, category, etc.). The system reads the inventory data from a pre-formatted text file and allows users to search using a command-line interface.

User Stories:
1. Quickly find the products they need in the inventory based on various parameters
2. See product details such as price and quantity to make informed decisions
3. Browse through a list of the products in the inventor

I got 85/100 for the project with an amazing feedback
